Autodidact provides a method to create https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.vscode-didact[VS Code Didact] files from plain Markdown or AsciiDoc:

* Commands become active in VS Code
* Terminals can be created, named, and updated.
* Reports driven by SQL can be included in AsciiDoc.
* Together, these features above allow you create, test, and improve tutorials and READMEs.
* All the markup (Markdown or AsciiDoc) remains publishable by existing channels (GitHub*, GitLab, Asciidoctor, Gatsby, etc).

Automate the creation of  tutorials.

This code helps create didact tutorials from existing files.
