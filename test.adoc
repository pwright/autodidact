# Autodidact

Automate the creation of vscode didact tutorials.

This code helps create didact tutorials from existing files.

## Example


To see this in action, consider this README file, to convert it to didact:

----
$ npm i
----

That installs the required dependencies, now you can install autodidact as a global command:

----
$ npm i -g .
----


To convert the README.md file:

----
$ autodidact asciidoc.adoc
----

## What's in scope

Single line commands and links in comments are converted using the following format:

:comment: //
[subs="+attributes"]
----
{comment} <didact link> didactlink
----

// link:didact://?commandId=workbench.action.showCommands[Click here to command pallette] didactlink

A tutorial might consist of a number of commands, eg:

----
$ date
Wed 17 Feb 13:30:31 GMT 2021
----

The command output should appear as a separate entity.

[bash,term=west]
----
$ ls -al
----
